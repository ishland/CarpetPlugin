# CarpetPlugin

[![Codacy Badge](https://api.codacy.com/project/badge/Grade/32e8b01100ad420b92f0fb704fd02eba)](https://app.codacy.com/gh/ishlandbukkit/CarpetPlugin?utm_source=github.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=ishlandbukkit/CarpetPlugin&utm_campaign=Badge_Grade_Settings)

Carpets can also be made of Paper!  
A bukkit plugin aims to implement as many features as [fabric-carpet](https://github.com/gnembon/fabric-carpet) does.  
This is the [Paper](http://papermc.io/) version of Carpet Mod, for Minecraft 1.16.2.  
For Fabric version check [gnembon/fabric-carpet](https://github.com/gnembon/fabric-carpet)  

## Compatibility
Currently, it is only compatible with `v1_16_R2` (1.16.2/1.16.3) with Paper or its fork

Backward and forward support is extremely difficult, and I won't do that.

## Implemented features
- /player ... spawn (carpet.player.spawn) (carpet.player.spawn.whitelist)
- /player ... kill (carpet.player.kill)
- /player ... sprint (carpet.player.sprint)
- /player ... unsprint (carpet.player.sprint)
- /player ... sneak (carpet.player.speak)
- /player ... unsneak (carpet.player.sneak)
- /player ... stop (carpet.player.stop)
- /player ... actions (carpet.player.actions)
